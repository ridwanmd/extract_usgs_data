This Python script (extract_usgs_data.py) is designed to extract specific data from a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data file (usgs_data.txt). The data extraction is based on a given parameter description. The code includes a function, extract_usgs_data, which takes the data file path and the desired parameter description as inputs, then extracts and returns the corresponding data.

Features
Dynamic Line Number Detection: The script dynamically determines the starting line for data based on the provided parameter description. It also identifies the line number containing the column names, skipping unnecessary lines.

Reduced Redundancy: The data_path parameter is utilized within the function, reducing redundancy and making it easier to adapt the script for different data files.

Example Usage
python
Copy code
data_path = "usgs_data.txt"
param_desc = "Precipitation, total, inches (Sum), [Operational]"

data = extract_usgs_data(data_path, param_desc)

if data is not None:
    print(data)
This example demonstrates how to use the script to extract and print data for a specific parameter description.

How to Use
Ensure that you have a valid USGS data file (e.g., usgs_data.txt).
Import the extract_usgs_data function into your script or notebook.
Call the function with the appropriate data_path and param_desc parameters.
Feel free to customize the function to fit your specific requirements or integrate it into your data analysis pipeline.
